Hardware
---------

To start to build a computer cluster for ab-initio calculations, 
stuffs that we have to collect first are as follows:

* CPU
* Mother board
* Hard disk drive (HDD)
* Memory
* Power supply unit
* Computer case
* Network hub
* Cables
* RAID system

The cost may be several hundreds dollers per one node. The other cost
is negligible when increaing the number of nodes.

Software
--------

* Ubuntu linux (or any linux distribution you like)
* MPI
* NFS
* LDAP
* Ganglia (monitoring system)
* Torque & Maui (queueing system)
