How to build linux cluster for ab-initio calculations
=====================================================

Introduction
------------

Due to the rapid growth of computer hardwares and softwares and
theories and algorithms of ab-initio calculations, we are now at the
stage we can build and use private computer clusters for ab-initio
calculations. Here I will show my experience of how to build and use
such the self-made computer clusters.

I will focus on the cheap computer cluster. The hardware will be
limited to usual computers which are sold in usual market. To employ
open source softwares is strongly recommened, because, thanks to the
internet, those are obtained everywhere if you are connected to the
internet and you don't need to be annoyed by complicated license
problems.
